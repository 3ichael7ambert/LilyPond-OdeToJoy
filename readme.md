# LilyPond

I love to make music and I love to program.
So how about we make music with programming languages?

```ly
\relative c' {
  c d e | e d c d | e e f g | g f e d |
  c d e | e d c d | e e f g | g f e d |
  c2 g, a, b, | c2 a g f | e d c d | e2 g f e | d2 c2 c2 |
}


```

This example shows a simple LilyPond file but it is used for LilyPond.
